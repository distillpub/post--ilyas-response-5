  <h1>Adversarial Examples are Just Bugs, Too</h1>
  <p>Refining the source of adversarial examples</p>
</d-title>
<d-article>
<p>
  We demonstrate that there exist adversarial examples which are just "bugs": aberrations in the classifier
  that are not
  intrinsic properties of the data distribution.
  In particular, we give a new method for constructing adversarial examples which:
</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
   Do not transfer between models, and
    </li>
    <li>
      Do not leak features which allow for "non-robust learning", in the
  sense of Ilyas-Santurkar-Tsipras-Engstrom-Tran-Madry
  <d-cite key="bugs"></d-cite>.
    </li>
  </ol>

<p>
  We replicate the Ilyas et. al
  experiment that "Non-robust features suffice for standard classification"
  (Sec 3.2 of <d-cite key="bugs"></d-cite>),
  and show that it fails for our construction of adversarial examples.
</p>  
  <p>
   The message is, whether adversarial examples are features or bugs depends
   on how you find them &mdash; standard PGD finds features, but bugs are abundant as well.
</p>  

<p>
  We also give a simple example of a data distribution which has no "non-robust features"
  (under any reasonable definition of feature), but for which standard training yields a highly non-robust classifier.
This demonstrates, again, that adversarial examples can occur even if the data distribution does not intrinsically have any "vulnerable directions."
</p>

<!--    It is possible to construct examples which:
   (A) transfer between models, and contain features of the target class
   (at least, learning from these mislabeled examples works nontrivially).
   But it is also possible to construct examples which
   (B) do not transfer between models, and do not contain features of the target class (at least, learning fails catastrophically). -->

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
Ilyas et. al <d-cite key="bugs"></d-cite>
argue that adversarial examples occur only
in directions intrinsic to the data distribution.
They postulate the following two worlds
<d-footnote>As described to us by the original authors.</d-footnote>
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>World 1: Adversarial examples exploit directions irrelevant for classification.
  </b>
In this world, adversarial examples occur because classifiers behave
poorly off-distribution,
when they are evaluated on inputs that are not natural images.
Here, adversarial examples would occur in arbitrary directions,
having nothing to do with the true data distribution.
</li>

<li>
<b>World 2: Adversarial examples exploit useful directions for classification.</b>
In this world, adversarial examples occur in directions that are still "on-distribution",
and which contain features of the target class.
For example, consider the perturbation that
makes an image of a dog to be classified as a cat.
In World 2, the perturbation is not purely random, but has something to do with cats.
Moreover, we expect that this perturbation transfers to other classifiers trained to distinguish cats vs. dogs.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Our main contribution is demonstrating that these worlds are not mutually exclusive -- and in fact, we are in both.
Ilyas et al. <d-cite key="bugs"></d-cite>
show that there exist adversarial examples in World 2, and we show there exist
examples in World 1.

<h2>
  Constructing Non-transferrable Targeted Adversarial Examples
</h2>
<p>
<!-- Consider a classification problem with data distribution $\cD$.
Let $f: \R^n \to \cY$ be a standard classifier for this problem. -->
We propose a method to construct targeted adversarial examples for a given classifier
$f$,
which do not transfer to other classifiers trained for the same problem.
</p>

<p>
Recall that for a classifier $f$, an input example $(x, y)$, and target class $y_{targ}$,
a <em>targeted adversarial example</em> is an $x'$ such that $||x - x'||\leq \eps$ and
$f(x') = y_{targ}$.
</p>

<p>
The standard method of constructing adversarial examples is via PGD,
which starts at input $x$, and iteratively takes steps $\{x_t\}$
to minimize the loss $L(f, x_t, y_{targ})$.
That is, we take steps in the direction 
$$-\nabla_x L(f, x_t, y_{targ})$$
where $L(f, x, y)$ is the loss of $f$ on input $x$, label $y$.
</p>
<d-footnote>
PGD is the following:
<ul>
<li>
Input: A classifier $f$, an input example $(x, y)$, and target class $y_{targ}$.
</li>
<li>
Initialize: $x_0 \gets x$.
</li>
<li>
  Iterative Step: Step in the direction of the gradient towards the target class
$$x_{t+1} \gets \Pi_\eps[ x_t - \alpha\nabla_x L(f, x_t, y_{targ}) ]$$
where $\alpha > 0$ is a step-size,
$L(f, x, y)$ is the loss of classifier $f$ on input $x$, label $y$.
And $\Pi_\eps$ is the projection onto the $\eps$-ball around $x$.
</li>
</ul>
</d-footnote>

<p>
  Note that since PGD steps in the gradient direction towards the target class,
  we may expect these adversarial examples have <em>feature leakage</em> from the target class.
  For example, suppose we are perturbing an image of a dog into a plane (which usually appears against a blue background).
  It is plausible that the gradient direction tends to make the dog image more blue,
  since the "blue" direction is correlated with the plane class.
  In our construction below, we attempt to eliminate such feature leakage.

    <img src="./manifold.svg"/>
  </figure>
  <figcaption>
    A visualization of the image-manifold for adversarially perturbing a dog to a plane.
    The gradient of the loss can be thought of as having an on-manifold "feature component"
    and an off-manifold "random component".
    PGD steps along both components, hence causing feature-leakage in adversarial examples.
    Our construction below attempts to step only in the off-manifold direction.
  </figcaption>

</p>

<h3>Our Construction</h3>
<p>
Let $\{f_i : \R^n \to \cY\}_i$ be an ensemble of classifiers
for the same classification problem as $f$.
For example, we can let $\{f_i\}$ be a collection of ResNet18s trained from
different random initializations.
</p>

<p>
  We perform iterative updates to find adversarial attacks, as in PGD.
  However, instead of stepping directly in the gradient direction, we
  step in the direction
<d-footnote>
Formally, we replace the iterative step with
$$x_{t+1} \gets \Pi_\eps\left( x_t
- \alpha( \nabla_x L(f, x_t, y_{targ}) + \E_i[ \nabla_x L(f_i, x_t, y)]) \right)$$
</d-footnote>
$$-\left( \nabla_x L(f, x_t, y_{targ}) + \E_i[ \nabla_x L(f_i, x_t, y)] \right)$$

That is, instead of taking gradient steps to minimize $L(f, x, y_{targ})$,
we minimize the "decorrelated loss"
<d-footnote>
  We could also consider explicitly using the ensemble to decorrelate,
  by stepping in direction
  $\nabla_x L(f, x, y_{targ}) - \E_i[ \nabla_x L(f_i, x, y_{targ})]$.
  This works as well, but the given loss has better optimization properties.
</d-footnote>
$$L(f, x, y_{targ}) + \E_i[L(f_i, x, y)]$$
This loss encourages finding an $x_t$ which is adversarial for $f$,
but not for the ensemble $\{f_i\}$.
</p>

<p>
These adversarial examples will not be adversarial for the ensemble $\{f_i\}$. But perhaps surprisingly, these examples are also not adversarial for
<em>new</em> classifiers trained for the same problem.
</p>


<h3>Experiments</h3>
<p>
We train a ResNet18 on CIFAR10 as our target classifier $f$.
For our ensemble, we train 10 ResNet18s on CIFAR10, from fresh random initializations.
We then test the probability that
a targeted attack for $f$
transfers to a new (freshly-trained) ResNet18, with the same targeted class.
Our construction yields adversarial examples which do not transfer well to new models.

<h2>Adversarial Examples With No Features</h2>
<p>
Using the above, we can construct adversarial examples
which <em>do not suffice</em> for learning.
Here, we replicate the Ilyas et. al experiment 
that "Non-robust features suffice for standard classification"
(Section 3.2 of <d-cite key="bugs"></d-cite>),
but show that it fails for our construction of adversarial examples.
</p>

<p>
To review, the Ilyas et. al non-robust experiment was:
<ol>
  <li> 
    Train a standard classifier $f$ for CIFAR.
  </li>
  <li>
    From the CIFAR10 training set $S = \{(X_i, Y_i)\}$,
    construct an alternate train set $S' = \{(X_i', Y_i + 1)\}$,
    where $X_i'$ is an adversarial example for $f(X_i)$, towards target class $Y_i+1 (\text{mod }10)$.
    Note that $S'$ appears to humans as "mislabeled examples".
  </li>
  <li>
    Train a new classifier $f'$ on train set $S'$.
    Observe that this classifier has non-trivial accuracy on the original CIFAR distribution.
  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The conclusion of Ilyas et. al. is that Step (3) shows
adversarial examples must have a meaningful "feature" component.

However, for adversarial examples constructed using our method, Step (3) fails.
In fact, $f'$ has good accuracy with respect to the "label-shifted" distribution
$(X, Y+1)$, which is intuitively what we trained on.

<h2>Adversarial Squares: Adversarial Examples from Robust Features</h2>
<p>
To further illustrate that adversarial examples can be "just bugs",
we show that they arise even when the true data distribution has no "non-robust features" --
that is, no intrinsically vulnerable directions.
<d-footnote>
We are unaware of a satisfactory definition of "non-robust features", but we claim that for any reasonable
<em>intrinsic</em> definition this problem has no non-robust features.
Intrinsic here meaning, a definition which depends only on properties of the data distribution, and not on the family of classifiers, or the finite-sample training set.</d-footnote>
</p>

<p>
The problem is to distinguish between CIFAR-sized images that are either all-black or all-white,
with a small amount of random input-noise and label noise.
</p>

    <center>
    <img src="./twosquares.png" style="width:50%"/>
    </center>
  <figcaption>
    <center>
    A sample of images from the distribution.
    </center>
  </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
Formally:
$$Y \sim \{\pm 1\} , \quad X := (\mathbb{1}^{32 \times 32 \times 3} + \eta_\eps) \cdot Y \cdot \eta$$
where $\eta \in \{\pm 1\} \sim Bernoulli(0.1)$ is the 10% label noise, and $\eta_\eps \sim [-0.1, +0.1]^n$
is uniform $L_\infty$ input-noise.
  </p>

<p>

Notice that there exists a trivial robust classifier for this problem which achieves perfect robust classification, with to $\eps = 0.4$ magnitude $L_\infty$ attacks.
However, if we sample 10000 training images from this distribution, and train
a ResNet18 to 99.9% train accuracy
<d-footnote>
We optimize using Adam with learning-rate $0.00001$ and batch size $128$ for 20 epoches.
</d-footnote>
,the resulting classifier is highly non-robust -- it has 0% robust accuracy even with $\eps=0.01$ perturbations.
</p>

<p>
The input-noise and label noise are both essential for this construction.
One intuition for what is happening is: in the initial stage of training
the optimization learns the "correct" decision boundary (indeed, stopping after 1 epoch results in a robust classifier).
However, optimizing to the point of $\approx 0$ train-error requires a highly non-Lipshitz network
to fit the label-noise, which hurts robustness.

<h2>Experimental Details</h2>
<p>
We use cross-entropy loss,
and images normalized to lie within $[0, 1]^{32 \times 32 \times 3}$.
</p>

<p>
For $L_2$ attacks, we used $\eps = 2.5$,
step-size $\alpha = 0.5$, and 10 PGD steps.
As is standard, we use a variant of PGD
where we normalize the size of each gradient step to be of $L_2$-norm
$\alpha$.
</p>

<p>
For $L_\infty$ attacks, we used $\eps= 8/ 255$ and $\alpha = 2/255$, and 10 PGD steps.
As is standard, we take steps using the sign of the gradient.
