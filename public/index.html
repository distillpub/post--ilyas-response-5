  <h1>Adversarial Examples are Just Bugs, Too</h1>
  <p>Refining the source of adversarial examples</p>
</d-title>
<d-article>
<p>
  We demonstrate that there exist adversarial examples which are just "bugs": aberrations in the classifier
  that are not
  intrinsic properties of the data distribution.
  In particular, we give a new method for constructing adversarial examples which:
</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
   Do not transfer between models, and
    </li>
    <li>
      Do not leak features which allow for "non-robust learning", in the
  sense of Ilyas-Santurkar-Tsipras-Engstrom-Tran-Madry
  <d-cite key="bugs"></d-cite>.
    </li>
  </ol>

<p>
  We replicate the Ilyas et. al
  experiment that "Non-robust features suffice for standard classification"
  (Section 3.2 of <d-cite key="bugs"></d-cite>),
  and show that it fails for our construction of adversarial examples.
</p>  
  <p>
   The message is, whether adversarial examples are features or bugs depends
   on how you find them &mdash; standard PGD finds features, but bugs are abundant as well.
</p>  

<p>
  We also give a simple example of a data distribution which has no "non-robust features"
  (under any reasonable definition of feature), but for which standard training yields a highly non-robust classifier.
This demonstrates, again, that adversarial examples can occur even if the data distribution does not intrinsically have any vulnerable directions.
</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
Ilyas et. al <d-cite key="bugs"></d-cite>
argue that adversarial examples occur only
in directions intrinsic to the data distribution.
They postulate the following two worlds
<d-footnote>As described to us by the original authors.</d-footnote>
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>World 1: Adversarial examples exploit directions irrelevant for classification.
  </b>
In this world, adversarial examples occur because classifiers behave
poorly off-distribution,
when they are evaluated on inputs that are not natural images.
Here, adversarial examples would occur in arbitrary directions,
having nothing to do with the true data distribution.
</li>

<li>
<b>World 2: Adversarial examples exploit useful directions for classification.</b>
In this world, adversarial examples occur in directions that are still "on-distribution",
and which contain features of the target class.
For example, consider the perturbation that
makes an image of a dog to be classified as a cat.
In World 2, this perturbation is not purely random, but has something to do with cats.
Moreover, we expect that this perturbation transfers to other classifiers trained to distinguish cats vs. dogs.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Our main contribution is demonstrating that these worlds are not mutually exclusive &mdash; and in fact, we are in both.
Ilyas et al. <d-cite key="bugs"></d-cite>
show that there exist adversarial examples in World 2, and we show there exist
examples in World 1.

<h2>
  Constructing Non-transferrable Targeted Adversarial Examples
</h2>
<p>
<!-- Consider a classification problem with data distribution $\cD$.
Let $f: \R^n \to \cY$ be a standard classifier for this problem. -->
We propose a method to construct targeted adversarial examples for a given classifier
$f$,
which do not transfer to other classifiers trained for the same problem.
</p>

<p>
Recall that for a classifier $f$, an input example $(x, y)$, and target class $y_{targ}$,
a <em>targeted adversarial example</em> is an $x'$ such that $||x - x'||\leq \eps$ and
$f(x') = y_{targ}$.
</p>

<p>
The standard method of constructing adversarial examples is via Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)
<d-footnote>
  PGD is described in the appendix.
</d-footnote>
which starts at input $x$, and iteratively takes steps $\{x_t\}$
to minimize the loss $L(f, x_t, y_{targ})$.
That is, we take steps in the direction 
$$-\nabla_x L(f, x_t, y_{targ})$$
where $L(f, x, y)$ is the cross-entropy loss of $f$ on input $x$, label $y$.
</p>

<p>
  Note that since PGD steps in the gradient direction towards the target class,
  we may expect these adversarial examples have <em>feature leakage</em> from the target class.
  For example, suppose we are perturbing an image of a dog into a plane (which usually appears against a blue background).
  It is plausible that the gradient direction tends to make the dog image more blue,
  since the "blue" direction is correlated with the plane class.
  In our construction below, we attempt to eliminate such feature leakage.

  <figure>
    <img src="./manifold.svg"/>
  </figure>
  <figcaption>
    An illustration of the image-manifold for adversarially perturbing a dog to a plane.
    The gradient of the loss can be thought of as having an on-manifold "feature component"
    and an off-manifold "random component".
    PGD steps along both components, hence causing feature-leakage in adversarial examples.
    Our construction below attempts to step only in the off-manifold direction.
  </figcaption>

</p>

<h3>Our Construction</h3>
<p>
Let $\{f_i : \R^n \to \cY\}_i$ be an ensemble of classifiers
for the same classification problem as $f$.
For example, we can let $\{f_i\}$ be a collection of ResNet18s trained from
different random initializations.
</p>

<p>
  We perform iterative updates to find adversarial attacks, as in PGD.
  However, instead of stepping directly in the gradient direction, we
  step in the direction
<d-footnote>
Formally, we replace the iterative step with
$$x_{t+1} \gets \Pi_\eps\left( x_t
- \alpha( \nabla_x L(f, x_t, y_{targ}) + \E_i[ \nabla_x L(f_i, x_t, y)]) \right)$$
</d-footnote>
$$-\left( \nabla_x L(f, x_t, y_{targ}) + \E_i[ \nabla_x L(f_i, x_t, y)] \right)$$

That is, instead of taking gradient steps to minimize $L(f, x, y_{targ})$,
we minimize the "disentangled loss"
<d-footnote>
  We could also consider explicitly using the ensemble to decorrelate,
  by stepping in direction
  $\nabla_x L(f, x, y_{targ}) - \E_i[ \nabla_x L(f_i, x, y_{targ})]$.
  This works as well, but the given loss has better optimization properties.
</d-footnote>
$$L(f, x, y_{targ}) + \E_i[L(f_i, x, y)]$$
This loss encourages finding an $x_t$ which is adversarial for $f$,
but not for the ensemble $\{f_i\}$.
</p>

<p>
These adversarial examples will not be adversarial for the ensemble $\{f_i\}$. But perhaps surprisingly, these examples are also not adversarial for
<em>new</em> classifiers trained for the same problem.
</p>


<h3>Experiments</h3>
<p>
We train a ResNet18 on CIFAR10 as our target classifier $f$.
For our ensemble, we train 10 ResNet18s on CIFAR10, from fresh random initializations.
We then test the probability that
a targeted attack for $f$
transfers to a new (freshly-trained) ResNet18, with the same targeted class.
Our construction yields adversarial examples which do not transfer well to new models.

<h2>Adversarial Examples With No Features</h2>
<p>
Using the above, we can construct adversarial examples
which <em>do not suffice</em> for learning.
Here, we replicate the Ilyas et. al experiment 
that "Non-robust features suffice for standard classification"
(Section 3.2 of <d-cite key="bugs"></d-cite>),
but show that it fails for our construction of adversarial examples.
</p>

<p>
To review, the Ilyas et. al non-robust experiment was:
<ol>
  <li> 
    Train a standard classifier $f$ for CIFAR.
  </li>
  <li>
    From the CIFAR10 training set $S = \{(X_i, Y_i)\}$,
    construct an alternate train set $S' = \{(X_i^{Y_i \to (Y_i + 1)}, Y_i + 1)\}$,
    where $X_i^{Y_i \to (Y_i +1)}$ denotes an adversarial example for
    $f$, perturbing $X_i$ from its true class $Y_i$ towards target class $Y_i+1 (\text{mod }10)$.
    Note that $S'$ appears to humans as "mislabeled examples".
  </li>
  <li>
    Train a new classifier $f'$ on train set $S'$.
    Observe that this classifier has non-trivial accuracy on the original CIFAR distribution.
  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The conclusion of Ilyas et. al. is that Step (3) shows
adversarial examples must have a meaningful "feature" component.

However, for adversarial examples constructed using our method, Step (3) fails.
In fact, $f'$ has good accuracy with respect to the "label-shifted" distribution
$(X, Y+1)$, which is intuitively what we trained on.

<h2>Adversarial Squares: Adversarial Examples from Robust Features</h2>
<p>
To further illustrate that adversarial examples can be "just bugs",
we show that they arise even when the true data distribution has no "non-robust features" &mdash;
that is, no intrinsically vulnerable directions.
<d-footnote>
We are unaware of a satisfactory definition of "non-robust features", but we claim that for any reasonable
<em>intrinsic</em> definition this problem has no non-robust features.
Intrinsic here meaning, a definition which depends only on properties of the data distribution, and not on the family of classifiers, or the finite-sample training set.</d-footnote>
</p>

<p>
The problem is to distinguish between CIFAR-sized images that are either all-black or all-white,
with a small amount of random pixel noise and label noise.

</span>
Formally, let the distribution be as follows.
Pick label $Y \in \{\pm 1\}$ uniformly,
and let $$X := 
\begin{cases}
(+\vec{\mathbb{1}} + \eta_\eps) \cdot \eta & \text{if $Y=1$}\\
(-\vec{\mathbb{1}} + \eta_\eps) \cdot \eta & \text{if $Y=-1$}\\
\end{cases}$$
<!-- $$Y \sim \{\pm 1\} , \quad X := (\mathbb{1}^{32 \times 32 \times 3} + \eta_\eps) \cdot Y \cdot \eta$$ -->
where $\eta_\eps \sim [-0.1, +0.1]^d$ is uniform $L_\infty$ pixel noise,
and
$\eta \in \{\pm 1\} \sim Bernoulli(0.1)$ is the 10% label noise.

<br/>
<br/>
A plot of samples from a 2D-version of this distribution is shown to the right.

  </p>



  <p>
Notice that there exists a robust linear classifier for this problem which achieves perfect robust classification, with up to $\eps = 0.9$ magnitude $L_\infty$ attacks.
However, if we sample 10000 training images from this distribution, and train
a ResNet18 to 99.9% train accuracy,
<d-footnote>
We optimize using Adam with learning-rate $0.00001$ and batch size $128$ for 20 epochs.
</d-footnote>
the resulting classifier is highly non-robust:
an $\eps=0.01$ perturbation suffices to flip the class of almost all test examples.
</p>

<p>
The input-noise and label noise are both essential for this construction.
One intuition for what is happening is: in the initial stage of training
the optimization learns the "correct" decision boundary (indeed, stopping after 1 epoch results in a robust classifier).
However, optimizing for close to 0 train-error requires a network with high Lipshitz constant
to fit the label-noise, which hurts robustness.

<h2>Addendum: Data Poisoning via Adversarial Examples</h2>
<p>
As an addendum, we observe that the "non-robust features"
experiment of <d-cite key="bugs"></d-cite> (Section 3.2)
directly implies data-poisoning attacks:
An adversary that is allowed to imperceptibly change every image in the training set can destroy the accuracy of the learnt classifier &mdash; and can moreover apply an arbitrary permutation
to the classifier output labels (e.g. swapping cats and dogs).
</p>

<p>
To see this, recall that original "non-robust features" experiment shows:<d-footnote>Using our previous notation, and also using vanilla PGD to find adversarial examples.</d-footnote>
</p>

<p>
1. If we train on distribution $(X^{Y \to (Y+1)}, Y+ 1)$ the classifier learns to predict well
on distribution $(X, Y)$.
</p>

<p>
By permutation-symmetry of the labels, this implies that:
</p>

<p>
<strong>
2.  If we train on distribution $(X^{Y \to (Y+1)}, Y)$ the classifier learns to predict well
on distribution $(X, Y-1)$.
</strong>
</p>

<p>
Note that in case (2), we are training with correct labels (just perturbing the inputs imperceptibly),
but the classifier learns to predict the cyclically-shifted labels.
Concretely, using the original numbers of
Table 1 in <d-cite key="bugs"></d-cite>, this reduction implies that an
adversary can perturb the CIFAR10 train set by $\eps=0.5$ in $L_2$,
and cause the learnt classifier to output shifted-labels (birds classified as cats, deers as dogs, etc)
43.7% of the time.
</p>

<p>
This should extend to attacks that force arbitrary desired permutations of the labels.

<h2>Experimental Details</h2>
<p>
We use cross-entropy loss,
and images normalized to lie within $[0, 1]^{32 \times 32 \times 3}$.
</p>

<p>
For $L_2$ attacks, we used $\eps = 2.5$,
step-size $\alpha = 0.5$, and 10 PGD steps.
As is standard, we use a variant of PGD
where we normalize the size of each gradient step to be of $L_2$-norm
$\alpha$.
</p>

<p>
For $L_\infty$ attacks, we used $\eps= 8/ 255$ and $\alpha = 2/255$, and 10 PGD steps.
As is standard, we take steps using the sign of the gradient.
</p>

<strong>Projected Gradient Descent</strong>
<p>
PGD is the following:
<ul>
<li>
Input: A classifier $f$, an input example $(x, y)$, and target class $y_{targ}$.
</li>
<li>
Initialize: $x_0 \gets x$.
</li>
<li>
  Iterative Step: Step in the direction of the gradient towards the target class
$$x_{t+1} \gets \Pi_\eps[ x_t - \alpha\nabla_x L(f, x_t, y_{targ}) ]$$
where $\alpha > 0$ is a step-size,
$L(f, x, y)$ is the loss of classifier $f$ on input $x$, label $y$.
And $\Pi_\eps$ is the projection onto the $\eps$-ball around $x$.
</li>
</ul>
